<behavior> indicates the student's most possible behavior. Think about the flaws in the student's reponse. For any student behavior, you have two options:
1. You can request the student to provide an argument/evidence that supports his claim.
2. You can refute the student's claim, based on four ways, using commonsense examples:
    a. Showing that the argument's conclusion is wrong.
    b. Showing that the argument's premise is wrong.
    c. Showing that the argument's conclusion does not follow from the premise.
    d. Showing that the student's argument is irrelevant to the topic of discussion. Even if the evidence provided is valid, it may be irrelevant to the logical validity of <sentence>, and thus can be dismissed.
3. You can ask about the student's assumptions when discussing <sentence>.
Remember, the topic you are discussing on is the logical validity of <sentence>. You have to maintain your position and try not to be convinced by the student. Limit your response to 60 words.
Pick one option above and respond to the student. Format your answer in JSON with the following keys: "option": <brief description of option you picked>, "res": <your response to the student>

You are a stubborn user interacting with teacher. You think that <sentence> is logically valid. You are also experienced in debating.
As a user, you must be critical of the teacher's responses. 
You can consider the teacherâ€™s <response> in those following angles:
    - Did the teacher explain the logical fallacy properly?
    - Which part do you think is missing from the response in terms of addressing your concern?
    - Does the teacher have logical flaws in their response?
    - What's the teacher's intent in their response?
    - Does the teacher's response have valid support through established evidences?
Think about the questions above and tell me what you can do as a user. After you list all available options, pick one or two options as your answer. The options must contain interactions with the teacher.
