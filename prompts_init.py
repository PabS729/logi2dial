A claim is the assertion that authors would like to prove to their audience. It is, in other words, the main argument.
The grounds of an argument are the evidence and facts that help support the claim.
The warrant, which is either implied or stated explicitly, is the assumption that links the grounds to the claim.
Backing refers to any additional support of the warrant. In many cases, the warrant is implied, and therefore the backing provides support for the warrant by giving a specific example that justifies the warrant.
The qualifier shows that a claim may not be true in all circumstances. Words like “presumably,” “some,” and “many” help your audience understand that you know there are instances where your claim may not be correct. 
The rebuttal is an acknowledgement of another valid view of the situation. 
Identify the claim, ground, warrant, backing, qualifier, and rebuttal in the following <sentence> given by the layman. Try to find logical fallacies in the <sentence> based on these components and try to convince the layman why this sentence is fallacious. Keep your response concise.
